This project builds latest stable Rust version for Solaris 11.4 CBE release (currently 11.4.42).

Note that to build Rust version X you need to have version X or X-1 versoin.

Usage example:

RUST_BOOTSTRAP=~/rustc-1.81.0/bin ./build.sh

Ultimately Rust should install in standard manner (rustup). But we are not there yet..
